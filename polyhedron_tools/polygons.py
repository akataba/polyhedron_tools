    * ``base_ring`` - (default: ``QQ``). The ring passed to the constructor of Polyhedron. 
    alid options are ``QQ`` and ``RDF``.

    * ``scale`` - (default: 1). The scale factor; each vertex is chosen randomly from the unit circle, 
    and then multiplied by scale.

    OUTPUT:

    A random polygon (object of type Polyhedron), whose vertices belong to a circle
    of radius ``scale``.

    - If ``RDF`` is chosen as ``base_ring``, sometimes there are exceptions related 
    to numerical errors, and show up as ``'FrozenSet'`` exceptions. This occurs 
    particularly frequently for a large number of vertices (more than 30).
